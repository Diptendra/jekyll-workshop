# Jekyll Workshop

Hello everybody! Welcome to the Jekyll workshop by OSAI.

You'll be going through the Jekyll step-by-step tutorial [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/), but we'll provide a different set of exercises for you to do in order to get comfortable with Jekyll. :D

In this workshop, you'll be creating a Jekyll site to detail your tips for surviving your UIUC classes! 

So, that being said, whenever you see the page tell you to *do* something, we recommend you follow **our** step-by-step tutorial (you can also do their tutorial if you want -- it's a free country). Their tutorial is great, but it's a little lacking in giving you the experience of actually *writing* Jekyll pages.


## Important Notes

1.) We're using "Linus" as a dummy name to put. Do put your own name instead :)
2.) This tutorial is harder than the default tutorial, but it should give you a better understanding of what Jekyll is. If you have any questions, send a message in the Discord and @Sahan!
3.) If you have any improvements or suggestions to make, please make a PR to this repo, or open an issue. We'd love to use this workshop for future years in the club, so we want this to be as useful as possible!
